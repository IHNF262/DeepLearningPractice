# Optimization Methods & Model with different optimization algorithms
Request:
  python 3.8
  
In this section, we still use the typical problem of 2D points classification to illustrate the effect of different optimization methods on the speed of the parameters convergence.

__Optimizations methods__(all on the mini_batch optimizations):  
  - (1): Gradient Descent
  - (2): Model with momentum 
  - (3): Model with Adam
