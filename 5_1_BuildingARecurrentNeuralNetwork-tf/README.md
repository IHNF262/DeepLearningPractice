# Building A Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)

Request:
  python 3.8
  
In this section, we try to show some typical examples with RNN or LSTM. 

## Dinasaur names: (employ RNN)

**we need a name generator to generate reasonable names, which can be constructed by training some input with existing names by RNN.**  

- (1)Open Training data :  
  There are 1536 reasonable names, and these names have a total of 19909 characters, 27 of which 27 are unique.'a'-'z' + '\n')  
  
- (2)training :  
   As the parameters, such as ___Wax, Waa, Wya, ba, by___ are unique, so the number of RNN units can vary with the length of input name characters.And in backward propagation for RNN, bias for each character all influence the gradient of parameters.
   
- (3)results :  
   now, we can generate new names based on our trained generator. we employ the SAMPLE function to implement the process.The input a(0) and x<1>(0) are initialized with zero.The y_hat value generated by each RNN units is selected randomly based on the probability weighting of softmax.
